## Source Files

The `src` directory is organized as follows:

```plaintext
├── ArduinoUNO
├── Communication_Dashboard_GUI
├── STM32
├── README.md
```

Descriptions of these directories, terminal based commands and design execution flow are added to the `README.md` of the individual directories.

#### General Description

- **ArduinoUNO**: contains `.ino` and `.c` files that are to be compiled using ArduinoIDE and uploaded as hex-files.
- **Communication_Dashboard_GUI**: contains code for the GUI
- **STM32**: contains the final code that has to be uploaded to NUCLEO board to make it into a programmer. Exact instructions are given in `/STM32/README.md`.
